## Current research initiatives:
### A) Survey of previous and current methods of alignment (RLHF, RLAIF, Inverse RL, CIRL, Weak to Strong...) and general concept of alignment
### B) Small Implementation Experiments:
1) Replicate alignment experiments
2) Place in /Implementations
3) (Optional) Generalize insights further investigate potential research topic
